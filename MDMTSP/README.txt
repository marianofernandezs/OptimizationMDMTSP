Multiple depot multiple traveling salesman problem (MDMTSP)

This directory contains C code for transforming the MDMTSP into the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP).
The transformation is accomplished using the algorithm developed by Oberlin et al.:

P Oberlin, S Rathinam, S Darbha,
A Transformation for a Multiple Depot, Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem.
2009 American Control Conference, 2009.

The subdirectory DAT contains the following MDMTSP instances:
 
Barreto (13 instances)
Prodhon (18 instances)
Tuzon (36 instances)

All were downloaded from http://prodhonc.free.fr.
